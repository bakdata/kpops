# Configuration

KPOps reads its global configuration that is unrelated to a pipeline's
[components](./components/overview.md) from [`config.yaml`](.#__codelineno-0-1).

Consider enabling [KPOps' editor integration](../editor-integration) feature to enjoy the benefits of
autocompletion and validation when configuring your pipeline.

To learn about any of the available settings, take a look at the example below.

??? example "`config.yaml`"

    ```yaml
      --8<--
      ./docs/resources/pipeline_config/config.yaml
      --8<--
    ```
