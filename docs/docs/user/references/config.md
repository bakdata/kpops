# Configuration

KPOps reads most of a [pipeline](/user/getting-started/quick-start/#deploying-the-word-count-pipeline)'s configuration that is not related to its [components](./components) from [`config.yaml`](/user/references/config).

Consider enabling [KPOps' editor integration](/user/references/editor-integration) feature to enjoy the benefits of autocompletion and validation when configuring your pipeline.

To learn about any of the available settings, take a look at the example below.

??? "`config.yaml`"

    ```yaml
      --8<--
      ./docs/resources/pipeline_config/config.yaml
      --8<--
