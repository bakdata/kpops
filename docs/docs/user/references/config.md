# Configuration

KPOps reads most of a pipeline's configuration that is unrelated to its [components](/user/references/components) from [`config.yaml`](/user/references/config/#__codelineno-0-1).

Consider enabling [KPOps' editor integration](/user/references/editor-integration) feature to enjoy the benefits of autocompletion and validation when configuring your pipeline.

To learn about any of the available settings, take a look at the example below.

??? example "`config.yaml`"

    ```yaml
      --8<--
      ./docs/resources/pipeline_config/config.yaml
      --8<--
