# Getting started

The getting started section gives you an overview of KPOps and how to work with it.

- In [Setup KPOps](./setup.md), you learn how to deploy the necessary infrastructure for running Kafka pipelines and how to install the KPOps CLI.
- In [Working with KPOps](./working-with-kpops.md), you will learn about the different components, how to use and configure them.
- The [Teardown](./teardown.md) covers the process of destroying everything you deployed in this guide.
