# Migrate from V2 to V3

## [Move GitHub action to repsitory root](https://github.com/bakdata/kpops/pull/356)

The location of the GitHub action has changed and it's now available directly as `bakdata/kpops`.

You'll need to change it in your GitHub CI workflows.

```diff
steps:
   - name: kpops deploy
-    uses: bakdata/kpops/actions/kpops-runner@main
+    uses: bakdata/kpops@main
     with:
       command: deploy --execute
       # ...
```
