# Migrate from V8 to V9

## [Introduce KPOps operation and manifest resources for deployment](https://github.com/bakdata/kpops/pull/541)

The `kpops manifest` command and `kpops.manifest()` API are removed.

Now you can manifest your resources based on the _operation_ (deploy, destroy, reset, clean). To do so you can pass the `--operation-mode manifest` when you call `kpops deploy/destroy/rest/clean` or you configure your KPOps to operate in this mode.

#### config.yaml

```diff
+ operation_mode: manifest

# rest of your config
```

## [Manifest toSection with Strimzi KafkaTopic](https://github.com/bakdata/kpops/pull/545)

KPOps can now manifest valid Kubernetes `KafkaTopic` resources from [Strimzi](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/blob/main/examples/topic/kafka-topic.yaml). If you configure your `operation_mode` to `manifest` or `argo` you need to specify the Strimzi cluster label. The label should match the with the deployed topic operator. For more information refer to the documentation on [deploying standalone topic operator](https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/latest/deploying#deploying-the-topic-operator-standalone-str).

```diff
operation_mode: manifest

+ strimzi_topic:
+  label:
+     strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster

# rest of your config
```
