# Migrate from V7 to V8

## [Add support for streams-bootstrap v3](https://github.com/bakdata/kpops/pull/519)

From now on KPOps supports [streams-bootstrap v3](https://github.com/bakdata/streams-bootstrap/releases/tag/3.0.1) as its default component. The previous streams-bootstrap version (below 3.x.x) is marked as deprecated and will be removed in future times. If you don't want to migrate your producer or streams app to v3, you should suffix your components with `-v2`. Here is an example of a `pipeline.yaml` file.

#### pipeline.yaml

```diff
- - type: producer-app
+ - type: producer-app-v2

- - type: streams-app-v2
+ - type: streams-app-v2

# rest of your pipeline
```

#### my-components.py

```diff
- class MyStreamsApp(StreamsApp):
+ class MyStreamsApp(StreamsAppV2):
    ...
```

!!! info The default components
    The `streams-boostrap`, `streams-app`, and `producer-app` now all take the Helm values of streams-bootstrap version 3. You can find these values under the [Helm charts documentation](https://github.com/bakdata/streams-bootstrap/tree/master/charts) or by [referring to the Base model definitions](https://github.com/bakdata/kpops/tree/v8/kpops/components/streams_bootstrap).

## [Make KafkaApp responsible for deploying/cleaning streams bootstrap components](https://github.com/bakdata/kpops/pull/522)

The `KafkaApp` component now only contains the deployment logic of the stream-bootstrap applications (streams-app, producer-app). It should not be used in the `defaults.yaml` nor the `pipeline.yaml`. If you are using it, it should be replaced by `streams-bootstrap`.

#### pipeline.yaml

```diff
- - type: kafka-app
+ - type: streams-bootsrap-v2
```

```
```
