# Migrate from V6 to V7

## [Automatic loading of namespaced custom components](https://github.com/bakdata/kpops/pull/500)

KPOps is now distributed as a Python namespace package (as defined by [PEP 420](https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/)). This allows us to standardize the namespace `kpops.components` for both builtin and custom pipeline components.

Some imports need to be adjusted:

**KPOps Python API**

```diff
-import kpops
+import kpops.api as kpops
```
