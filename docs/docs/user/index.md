# KPOps user guide

## What is KPOps?

KPOps is a CLI tool that allows deploying and destroying consecutive Kafka Streams applications, Producers, and Kafka Connectors using
an easy-to-read and write pipeline definition. KPOps comes with various abstractions that can simplify configuring multiple pipelines
and steps within pipelines by sharing configuration between different applications, like producers or streaming applications. In
addition, Kafka apps and its resources can be reset or cleaned up again with a single command.
