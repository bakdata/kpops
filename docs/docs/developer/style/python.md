# Python

To ensure a consistent Python code style, we use [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for both linting and formatting.

## Configuration

Our configuration can be found in [KPOps](https://github.com/bakdata/kpops)' top-level `pyproject.toml`.

## Editor integration

Below are listed existing Ruff plugins/extensions for some of the most popular python IDEs. If you cannot find your Editor of choices or you want something more custom, [`ruff-lsp`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-lsp) enables Ruff to be used in any editor that supports the LSP
